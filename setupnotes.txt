#installing virtualenv
sudo pip3 install virtualenv 

#creating virtualenv
cd projectdir
virtualenv virtenv

You can also use a Python interpreter of your choice by:
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv

#setting up mysql server
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Now, generally to use a predefined db schema we export it from our local pc and include it in git repo of our project and then go on to import it in our mysql server on remote.
BUT, in this proj the exported .sql file of our db is about 76 MB, too big, not allowed on git repo.
So, has to be uploded to remote server using any other way :
SFTP (simply SSH-FTP)
Here is the guide for trasfering files via SFTP :
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sftp-to-securely-transfer-files-with-a-remote-server

command to export .sql file : mysqldump -u root -p growthplug > growthplug.sql


Now after the file transfer is done to the appropriate folder on remote
Go to that folder and use the following commands to import it into mysql-server :
1) first open mysql shell and create a new db for importing, say "growthplug"
2) exit the shell and use below command to import .sql fie to the newly created db
3) mysql -u root -p growthplug < growthplug.sql
Done.
Check once via mysql shell to confirm.
